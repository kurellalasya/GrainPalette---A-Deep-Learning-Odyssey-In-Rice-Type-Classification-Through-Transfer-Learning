How to Run

Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/kurellalasya/GrainPalette---A-Deep-Learning-Odyssey-In-Rice-Type-Classification-Through-Transfer-Learning.git
cd GrainPalette---A-Deep-Learning-Odyssey-In-Rice-Type-Classification-Through-Transfer-Learning


Install dependencies (if not already installed):

pip install -r requirements.txt


Open the notebook in Google Colab or Jupyter:

Replace the old notebook with the updated one containing the modern Gradio app.

Run the notebook:

The Gradio app will launch directly inside Colab or locally in a browser.

You can upload rice images or use the webcam to see predictions.

Features in the Updated Version

Modern gradient background and semi-transparent content cards

Mobile-responsive layout

Colored Predict (green) and Clear (red) buttons with hover effects

Vibrant probability bar chart for rice type confidence
